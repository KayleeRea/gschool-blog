##### Crazy-Town: a state of disarray (initiated and used heavily by Mike Gehard: gSchool instructor, programming bad-ass)

It's Week 3 at gSchool. These first few weeks my brain feels as if it's been placed in a mixing bowl and simultaneously blended, stirred and
beaten with copious amounts of new information (see photo below). I'm happy to announce that, at last, mush is slowly but surely being pieced back together.

Yes, baking, among coding, is not a given skill of mine.

It's been a whirlwind. I walked into the gSchool classroom 3 weeks ago with no programming or coding experience and found
myself immersed in a world I had no idea existed. After working as a surgical assistant for an oral surgeon for the past 5 years, I had come to the realization that I didnâ€™t want to be staring into mouths for the rest of my career days. I'm utterly floored by the acceptance and willingness of the people that make up this world. We've been blessed with instructors that have an undeniable passion for what they do and their zest for programming undoubtedly rubs off on all of us.

We've dived into the deep end. Been introduced to GitHub, Heroku, forking, pushing, merging, branches, git commands, Ruby,
TDD, refactoring, HTTP, HTML, and about a hundred other concepts that would have just as well been Chinese to me a mere
month ago.

I've experienced humility in it's finest form. I've been confused, frustrated, overwhelmed and not to mention sleep-deprived.
But, quite frankly, I wouldn't have it any other way. There's nothing that beats the feeling of accomplishment when you're
code passes it's tests. Nothing that beats that feeling when the light-bulb goes on and the concepts just 'click'. Nothing
beats the sense of comradery within our class, or the eagerness and willingness of my fellow classmates to help.
And, most importantly nothing beats the undeniable hunger that I have for more of this 'Crazy-Town'.
