Month one of gSchool is in the books!

We were introduced to our mentors this week. I was lucky enough to be matched up with Ernie Miller. He's basically a celebrity
in the Ruby community. He shared a bit of his insight with me and proceeded to write an awesome blog post centered around advice
for a non-programmer joining the programming world.

We also cracked open Sinatra. Full speed ahead to a URL Shortener site.

There's been a recurring theme here at gSchool. We're introduced a topic and thrown in deep end. Although some messy
dog-paddling is involved I've luckily been able to stay above the surface. Some of the other gSchoolers and I came to
the conclusion that we're never going to be comfortable with this fast-pace learning. We see a glimpse of 'comfort' after
the initial push into the pool. It's down the street, but at least we're able to see it. Then all of a sudden more material
is introduced and 'comfort' is put on the back of a truck and driven around the corner. And the whole dog-paddling circle
begins again.

Pairing has been an incredible asset to my experience. It's awesome when two brains become one.
