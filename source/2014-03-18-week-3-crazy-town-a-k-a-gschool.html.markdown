###### Crazy-Town: a state of disarray (initiated and used heavily by Mike Gehard: gSchool instructor, programming bad-ass)

It's Week 3 at gSchool. Though my brain feels as if it's been placed in a blender and simultaneously chopped, stirred and
shaken with copious amounts of new information; I'm happy to announce that the mush is slowly but surely being pieced back
together.

It's been a whirlwind. I walked into the gSchool classroom 3 weeks ago with no programming or coding experience and found
myself immersed in a world I had no idea existed. I'm utterly floored by the acceptance and willingness of the people that
make up this world. We've been blessed with instructors that have an undeniable passion for what they do and their zest for
programming undoubtedly rubs off on all of us.

We've dived into the deep end. Been introduced to GitHub, Heroku, forking, pushing, merging, branches, git commands, Ruby,
TDD, refactoring, HTTP, HTML, and about a hundred other concepts that would have just as well been Chinese to me a mere
month ago.

I've experienced humility in it's finest form. I've been confused, frustrated, overwhelmed and not to mention sleep-deprived.
But, quite frankly, I wouldn't have it any other way. There's nothing that beats the feeling of accomplishment when you're
code passes it's tests. Nothing that beats that feeling when the light-bulb goes on and the concepts just 'click'. Nothing
beats the sense of comradery within our class, or the eagerness and willingness of my fellow classmates to help.
And, most importantly nothing beats the undeniable hunger that I have for more of this 'Crazy-Town'.

Month one of gSchool is in the books!

We were introduced to our mentors this week. I was lucky enough to be matched up with Ernie Miller. He's basically a celebrity
in the Ruby community. He shared a bit of his insight with me and proceeded to write an awesome blog post centered around advice
for a non-programmer joining the programming world.

We also cracked open Sinatra. Full speed ahead to a URL Shortener site.

There's been a recurring theme here at gSchool. We're introduced a topic and thrown in deep end. Although some messy
dog-paddling is involved I've luckily been able to stay above the surface. Some of the other gSchoolers and I came to
the conclusion that we're never going to be comfortable with this fast-pace learning. We see a glimpse of 'comfort' after
the initial push into the pool. It's down the street, but at least we're able to see it. Then all of a sudden more material
is introduced and 'comfort' is put on the back of a truck and driven around the corner. And the whole dog-paddling circle
begins again.

Pairing has been an incredible asset to my experience. It's awesome when two brains become one.
