Week 4 was a monumental one. Not only did we crack open Sinatra, we were introduced to our mentors, had our first paring sessions, got to talk to [John Foley](https://twitter.com/jw_foley) about his pairing experiences, had a great question/answer session with some former gSchool students, and without missing a beat; we moved full speed ahead into creating a URL shortener site from scratch. And yes, in case you’re wondering, my head is spinning.

I had the pleasure of getting to know [Ernie Miller](https://twitter.com/erniemiller) this week. If the name sounds familiar to you, it’s probably because you’ve heard of this so called Ruby celebrity before. He’s an amazing Rubyist, an incredible speaker, and most recently (much to my excitement), my mentor. I’m pleased to confess that he is just as down-to-earth, funny and genius as the reputation that proceeds him. In one my fist emails to him, I asked if he had any advice for a ‘non’-programmer entering this world.Check out his answer in his blog post..

The URL shortener site incorporated just about EVERYTHING we’ve learned in the past month, all in to one application. Our instructors, [Mike](https://twitter.com/mikegehard) and [Jeff](https://twitter.com/jeffrosoft) played product owners and were kind enough to provide us with mock-ups and pivotal tracker stories. Let’s just say, I couldn’t believe just how many moving parts were in what ‘seemed’ to me to be a simple website. We had been dealing with maybe 4 files max within our little Sinatra apps before this project and suddenly, BAM! 12 files later and we’re up and running on our Heroku staging site.


It’s hard to believe that next week, I’ll probably be looking back at this nostalgically saying, “That’s totally easy compared to this weeks material!” Matter-of-factly, that seems to be the recurring theme here at gSchool. Comfort is something of the past. There’s no-doubtably always something new to learn, always room for improvement, and always never enough time in the day.
