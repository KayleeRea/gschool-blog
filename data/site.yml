title: The Refactoration of Kaylee
subtitle: The Road from an Everday Surgical Assistant turned Junior Web Developer
subtitle2: After working as an Oral Surgeon's Assistant for the past 5 years, I came to the realization that I had become immensly bored. The switch was an easy one for me. One thing I can say for sure is that programming is kind of like puling teeth. Though sometimes programming is as frustrating and difficult as pulling teeth, I was intrigued by the constant mind-bending and brain power that coding undoubtably induces. Here I present to you, the trails and tribulations of this refactoration of me. Enjoy!
